# Fennec
Fennec, previously known as ScamWatch, is a software designed to provide an extra layer of protection against common scams that involve the use of remote-control access (RCA) applications.

The primary functions of this software are to block the installation of RCA applications, block remote connections, and notify the user when a remote connection is attempted. The secondary function of Fennec is to help educate the user in an effort to help promote awareness and provide links to helpful resources. Being caught in a scam can be incredibly isolating and hopefully these links can offer connection and help. NOTE: Ideally, these links would be localized to the user, however for now, localized links will be limited to Canadian resources.

It is not realistic to assume Fennec, or other similar applications, will fully prevent scams from happening as there are very obvious limitations. The goal, then, is to help make the user aware that they may be part of a scam and to alert a loved one to check up on them. For example, yes, the scammer could simply convince the victim to end the program from the task manager, however by the time they realize what Fennec is and what it is doing, Fennec will have alerted the user and hopefully make them question if what is happening is actually real or not.

**Fennec is a major WiP hahahaha
